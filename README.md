1) Work example by hand.
2)  Write down what you did.
3) Find patterns.
 4) Check by hand.
 5) Translate to code.
 6) Run test cases.
7) Debug failed test cases.
The seventh step was to debug failed test cases.  The first step is that you observe a phenomenon. In the case of your program, this is generally that it crashes or exhibit some incorrect behavior when you test it.
The next step in the scientific method is to ask a question. 
The next step is to gather information and apply expert knowledge.  As you gather information, you're going to realize other information you want to gather, and other things you want to think about. You keep doing this step until you're ready to form a hypothesis. When you form a hypothesis you're going to make at some statement which predicts behavior about your program. 
Once you've formed a hypothesis you're ready to test it. You're going to conduct some experiments to either reject the hypothesis if the behavior of your program contradicts it, in which case you're going to return back to gathering more information and applying your expert knowledge again. At this point, you've learned something new from the fact that your hypothesis was incorrect, so you have more knowledge to work from and are ready to form a better hypothesis. The alternative is we can become convinced that our hypothesis is correct because all of the evidence agrees with it, in which case we accept our hypothesis, we understand what's wrong with our program, and we're ready to act on it and fix our program.
