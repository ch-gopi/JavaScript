# JavaScript problem solving steps:
1) Work example by hand.
2)  Write down what you did.
3) Find patterns.
 4) Check by hand.
 5) Translate to code.
 6) Run test cases.
7) Debug failed test cases.
   #
The seventh step was to debug failed test cases.
The first step is that you observe a phenomenon. In the case of your program, this is generally that it crashes or exhibit some incorrect behavior when you test it.
The next step in the scientific method is to ask a question. 
The next step is to gather information and apply expert knowledge.  As you gather information, you're going to realize other information you want to gather, and other things you want to think about. You keep doing this step until you're ready to form a hypothesis. When you form a hypothesis you're going to make at some statement which predicts behavior about your program. 
Once you've formed a hypothesis you're ready to test it. You're going to conduct some experiments to either reject the hypothesis if the behavior of your program contradicts it, in which case you're going to return back to gathering more information and applying your expert knowledge again. At this point, you've learned something new from the fact that your hypothesis was incorrect, so you have more knowledge to work from and are ready to form a better hypothesis. The alternative is we can become convinced that our hypothesis is correct because all of the evidence agrees with it, in which case we accept our hypothesis, we understand what's wrong with our program, and we're ready to act on it and fix our program.


JavaScript, often abbreviated as JS, is a versatile and ubiquitous programming language that plays a central role in web development. Created by Brendan Eich in 1995, JavaScript was initially designed to add interactivity to web pages. Over the years, it has evolved into a full-fledged programming language that is not only used for frontend development but also for server-side scripting, mobile app development, and even desktop application development.

One of JavaScript's key strengths is its ability to run in web browsers, making it an essential language for creating dynamic and interactive web pages. It enables developers to manipulate the Document Object Model (DOM), allowing for real-time updates and changes to the content and structure of web pages without requiring a page reload. This asynchronous nature, coupled with its event-driven paradigm, contributes to a smoother and more responsive user experience.

JavaScript is an interpreted, high-level, and dynamically typed language. Its syntax is similar to other C-style languages, making it accessible to developers with diverse programming backgrounds. As a language that supports object-oriented, imperative, and functional programming styles, JavaScript offers flexibility in coding paradigms.

With the advent of Node.js, JavaScript expanded its reach to server-side development, allowing developers to use the same language for both frontend and backend tasks. This unification of the development stack simplifies the workflow and promotes code reuse. Furthermore, JavaScript has a rich ecosystem of libraries and frameworks, with popular choices like React, Angular, and Vue.js for frontend development, and Express.js for backend development.

JavaScript continues to evolve with the release of ECMAScript specifications, which define the language's standard features and syntax. Modern JavaScript, often referred to as ECMAScript 6 (ES6) and beyond, introduces enhancements such as arrow functions, classes, and modules, improving code readability and maintainability.

In summary, JavaScript is a fundamental language in the world of web development, driving interactivity and enhancing user experiences on the web. Its versatility, ease of adoption, and expansive ecosystem have contributed to its enduring popularity and widespread use across a variety of development scenarios.
